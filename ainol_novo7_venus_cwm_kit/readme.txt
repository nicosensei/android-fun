Thank you for downloading the CWM Recovery for Venus package.

A note from bnmguy
"This is for the Hero II. It may work with other devices as well, but I 
have not tested with them, nor have I even looked at any possible 
compatibility issues with them. If you decide to use this on them, I 
will not be able to help you if something goes wrong.

Please note, this is still an early build and WILL have some bugs. I am 
not responsible if it breaks your device. Flash at your own risk!!!

What's not working
USB Mounting
Reboot Recovery (Don't try it!)
Maybe other things?"
